## Portfolio

This repo collects the codes and projects I have done during the past years and throug my accademic journey.

### What you will find here
- Reproducible Python workflows for simulation and numerical modelling
- Machine learning classification models for noisy time/frequency series 
- Analytical and symbolic model building (Mathematica)
- Data processing and plotting utilities
- Time-series models GARCH/ARCH

### How to run
Most folders will include a short `requirements.txt` and a minimal entry point script.
If you clone the repo locally, typical usage is:

pip install -r requirements.txt  
python demo.py

### Notes
I am gradually adding polished, self contained examples and documentation.
