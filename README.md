## Shayan Hemmatyar

Former theoretical physicist with a PhD (Universität Heidelberg) and an MSc (ETH Zürich). I build reproducible Python and C workflows for scientific computing, simulation, and data analysis, and I apply machine learning to noisy time series problems.

### Featured projects
- Project A (Python): short one line description. Link coming soon.
- Project B (ML/time series): short one line description. Link coming soon.
- Project C (symbolic/numerical): short one line description. Link coming soon.

You can find the codes and projects I have done during the past years and throug my accademic journey in the repos.

### What you will find here
- Reproducible Python workflows for simulation and numerical modelling
- Machine learning classification models for noisy time/frequency series 
- Analytical and symbolic model building (Mathematica)
- Data processing and plotting utilities
- Time-series models GARCH/ARCH

### How to run
Most folders will include a short `requirements.txt` and a minimal entry point script.
If you clone the repo locally, typical usage is:

pip install -r requirements.txt  
python demo.py

### Notes
I am gradually adding polished, self contained examples and documentation.
